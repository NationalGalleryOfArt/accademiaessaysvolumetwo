### <p style="text-align: center;">Overview</p>

Welcome! The two essays included here — **“Girolama Parasole among the “Illustrious” in the Portrait Collection at the Accademia di San Luca”** by Susan Nalezyty and **“Printmaking and the Progression of the Arts in Rome: The Interested Case of Girolama Parasole”** by Evelyn Lincoln — were originally published in 2024 on an earlier version of the website for the digital project *The Early History of the Accademia di San Luca, c. 1590–1635: Documents from the Archivio di Stato di Roma*. Initiated in 2010, the project is a collaboration between the National Gallery’s [Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts](https://www.nga.gov/research/center), the Archivio di Stato di Roma, and the Accademia Nazionale di San Luca. It is conceived in two parts: a [volume of essays concerning the establishment of the Accademia](https://www.nga.gov/research/publications/accademia-seminars-accademia-di-san-luca-rome-c-1590-1635), edited by Peter M. Lukehart, and a database of rediscovered notarial documents that support current and future study of the Accademia and its members.
